# Hotel Booking Data Analysis

This project analyzes a hotel booking dataset to uncover insights about booking patterns, cancellations, and other trends. The analysis is presented in an interactive dashboard built with Streamlit.

## Key Findings

*   **Booking Cancellations:** A significant portion of bookings are canceled. The dashboard provides a detailed breakdown of cancellation rates.
*   **Hotel Types:** The dataset includes two types of hotels: Resort and City hotels. The booking patterns differ between the two.
*   **Seasonal Trends:** Bookings and cancellations show clear seasonal trends, with peaks in certain months.

## How to Run the Dashboard

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

2.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the Streamlit app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

4.  **View the dashboard:** Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

## Project Structure

*   `app.py`: The main Streamlit application script.
*   `eda.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook with the exploratory data analysis.
*   `archive (3).zip`: The zip file containing the `hotel_booking.csv` dataset.
*   `.gitignore`: Specifies files to be ignored by Git.
*   `README.md`: This file.

I will also need to create a `requirements.txt` file. I will do that in the next step.
